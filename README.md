# HackerRank Python solutions
Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van
Rossum and first released in 1991. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming,
and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.
Two major versions of Python are currently in active use:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3.exe) is the current version and is under active development.
- Python 2.x is the legacy version and will receive only security updates until 2020. No new features will be
implemented. Note that many projects still use Python 2, although migrating to Python 3 is getting easier.

## verify if python is installed
To confirm that Python was installed correctly, you can verify that by running the following command in your
favorite terminal (make sure to check box "add PATH to environment variable during installation or you can manually add path later)<br/>

``` >python --version ```

If you have Python 3 installed, and it is your default version you should see
something like this:
```
>python --version
python 3.8.2
```
you can also use an [interactive python shell online](https://www.python.org/shell/)
